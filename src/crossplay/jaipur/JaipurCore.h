// Jaipur, the rules. Freestanding: no renderer, no Activity, no storage.
//
// See docs/jaipur.md for the rulebook this implements and for the two state
// machines. The short version of the shape:
//
//   * `Game` is the whole shared state AND the wire format, 64 bytes. There is
//     one description of a game, so two devices cannot drift.
//   * Everything that can be derived is derived: scores, which tokens each
//     player holds, the value of a drawn bonus, the camel token, the winner,
//     the legal moves. A stored field that disagrees with a computed one is a
//     bug class that does not exist here.
//   * The opponent's hand lives in here the whole time. Nothing outside gets to
//     see it: `observe()` builds what an AI is allowed to know, and the screens
//     take a model that has no per-good array for the other seat.
