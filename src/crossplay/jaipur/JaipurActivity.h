// Jaipur. Touch only, in the fork's usual three layers: JaipurCore has the
// rules, JaipurScreens has the chrome, and this file is the only part that
// draws.
//
// The board is one screen and selling is not a separate view. You tap cards and
// the capsule at the bottom names the single action your selection currently
// means, live when it is legal and dithered when it is not. That falls out of
// the rules rather than being imposed on them: one market card is a take, two
// or more is an exchange, and a hand selection is a sale.
//
// Portrait, and the layout Mario picked from three rendered side by side. The
// two that lost: TABLE laid the market and the token rail out sideways, which
// left only 268px of body and cramped everything; PRICED put each pile's next
// token value on the card itself and dropped the pile zone entirely, which read
// well but threw away the depth pips -- and those pips are the round's clock,
// since three empty piles ends it.
