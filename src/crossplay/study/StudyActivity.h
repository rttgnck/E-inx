// The flashcard app. Reads a deck converted from Mario's Anki collection off
// the SD card, schedules with FSRS-5 plus Anki's learning steps, and draws a
// card face that follows his own Anki template -- including randomising the
// hanzi face per card, which is the point of the whole thing.
//
// The split docs/shelf.md asks for:
//
//   StudyFsrs / StudyScheduler / StudyDeck   freestanding, host-tested
//   StudyActivity                            this file: storage, fonts, input
//
// The card face is hand-drawn into the body rect rather than built from
// components, because it is the app's own surface in the sense docs/shelf.md
// means: a headword at 100px over a rule over an example sentence is not a
// list, and expressing it as one would fight the layout the whole way.
