// What the review log says about how study has actually been going.
//
// Mario asked for stats and for retraining in the first breath of this app.
// Retraining turned out not to need building: reviews sync back into Anki, so
// Anki's own "Optimize FSRS parameters" is the optimiser, and re-running
// anki_to_deck.py carries the new weights back to the device. See
// docs/study-deck-format.md.
//
// Stats do need building, and revlog.dat is the whole input. Freestanding C++17
// over the same ByteSource as StudyDeck, so host-tests/study can drive it with
// a synthetic log rather than a device.
//
// The log is append-only and grows without bound -- a year of heavy study is a
// couple of megabytes -- so this reads *backwards* from the end and stops as
// soon as it is past the window it cares about. A stats screen must not get
// slower the longer someone has been studying.
