// Freestanding C++17 -- no Arduino, no HalStorage, no heap. All I/O goes
// through the ByteSource interface, which is what lets host-tests/study parse a
// real converted deck on a laptop. The device supplies a HalStorage-backed
// source; the tests supply one over a plain file.
//
// Nothing here allocates. A Note is a fixed buffer the caller owns, because the
// review path touches one note per card and a per-card heap round trip on a
// device with no PSRAM headroom is exactly the kind of churn that fragments.
