// Hacker News, read on the device.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The shape of it, and the two decisions worth knowing.
//
// 1. Every network round trip is one request. The front page is one GET to
//    Algolia's search endpoint and a whole comment thread is one GET to its
//    items endpoint, already nested. The official Firebase API needs a request
//    per item, so the same two screens would cost 31 and 58 round trips over
//    TLS. See HackerNewsCore.h.
//
// 2. Nothing slow happens on the render path. A fetch is *requested* by setting
//    `pending_` and asking for a repaint; the loop performs it on the following
//    pass, once the loading screen is already on the panel. Upstream's font
//    downloader does the opposite and pins the main loop for forty seconds with
//    no repaint and no input, which is indistinguishable from a crash and shows
//    up in the log as `New max loop duration: 39864 ms`.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The reading itself is deliberately not clever. An article and a thread both
// become one flat, wrapped document that pages a screenful at a time, because
// that is what the panel is good at.
