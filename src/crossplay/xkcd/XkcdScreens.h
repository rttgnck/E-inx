// The xkcd screens. Freestanding builders in the ChessScreens mould: a model
// in, a drawn frame out, no renderer and no Activity, so host-tests/ui/ can
// assert what they drew and what they made tappable.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// **Portrait, 480x800**, like every other app on the device.
//
// The archive is 740px wide at source, so a portrait panel means the artwork
// is scaled to 480 -- but that happens once, on a host, with a real resampling
// filter (`build_pack.py --max-width 480`), and the device blits 1:1 whatever
// it is handed. The alternative was a landscape reader at native size, which
// is sharper and was built first; it lost because it made the whole app,
// browsing included, something you had to turn the device sideways for.
//
// What that leaves is one axis of motion. A comic 480 wide always fits the
// width, so the reader only ever pans **down**, half a screen at a time,
// snapped to a gap in the artwork. See XkcdCore.h.
//
// The reader is the one screen that is mostly not a screen: the comic is the
// app's own surface and the Activity blits it, exactly as chess draws its
// board. What lives here is the bar under it. `readerViewport()` is shared
// between the two so the rect that gets drawn and the rect that gets tapped
// are the same rect -- the rule that has caught more bugs in this fork than
// any other.
