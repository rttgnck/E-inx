// Chess rules engine: board state, move generation, make/unmake.
//
// Freestanding C++17 on purpose. No Arduino, no ESP-IDF, no renderer, no heap.
// That is what lets the whole ruleset be verified on the host with plain c++
// (see test/run.sh), which matters because move generation is where chess bugs
// hide: castling through check, en passant, promotion, discovered pins.
//
// Allocation: none. Every structure here is a fixed-size value type, so the
// caller decides where it lives. MoveList is ~1KB, too big for a C3 stack
// frame, so search and UI code must hold it as a member or static, never as a
// local. See ChessEngine and ChessActivity.
