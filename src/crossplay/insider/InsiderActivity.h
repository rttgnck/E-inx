// Insider: a party game for four to eight people and one device.
//
// The thing that makes this port work is that the device is never a screen you
// play on. It is a prop that gets handed round a table: it keeps the secret,
// it holds the clock, and it settles the argument at the end. Everything
// interesting happens between people, out loud, while it sits there.
//
// That is also why it needs no radio. The link layer is for two devices playing
// each other; this is one device and N humans, which is a different game shape
// entirely and a much older one.
