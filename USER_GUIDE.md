## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xtink X4 (in the same layout as the manufacturer firmware, by default):

### Button Layout
| Location        | Buttons                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bottom Edge** | **Back**, **Confirm**, **Left**, **Right**           |
| **Right Side**  | **Power**, **Volume Up**, **Volume Down**, **Reset** |

Button layout can be customized in **[Settings](#35-settings)**.

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for approximately half a second**.
In **[Settings](#35-settings)** you can configure the power button to turn the device off with a short press instead of a long one.

To reboot the device (for example if it's frozen, or after a firmware update), press and release the Reset button, and then quickly press and hold the Power button for a few seconds.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading.

---

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home Screen is the main entry point to the firmware. From here you can navigate to **[Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode)** with the most recently read book, **[Book Selection](#32-book-selection)**, **[Settings](#35-settings)**, or the **[File Upload](#34-file-upload-screen)** screen.

### 3.2 Book Selection

The Book Selection acts as a folder and file browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up and down through folders and books. You can also long-press these buttons to scroll a full page up or down.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.

### 3.3 Reading Mode

See [Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.4 File Upload Screen

The File Upload screen allows you to upload new e-books to the device. When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted with a WiFi selection dialog and then your X4 will start hosting a web server.

See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for more information on how to connect to the web server and upload files.

> [!TIP]
> Advanced users can also manage files programmatically or via the command line using `curl`. See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for details.

### 3.4.1 Calibre Wireless Transfers

Inx supports sending books from Calibre using the Inx Reader device plugin.

1. Install the plugin in Calibre:
   - Head to https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/calibre-plugins/releases to download the latest version of the crosspoint_reader plugin.
   - Download the zip file.
   - Open Calibre → Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file → Select the zip file.
2. On the device: File Transfer → Connect to Calibre → Join a network.
3. Make sure your computer is on the same WiFi network.
4. In Calibre, click "Send to device" to transfer books.

### 3.4.2 Bluetooth Transfer

Sends a book straight from an Android phone over Bluetooth. No WiFi network, no hotspot and
no pairing — the two devices talk to each other directly, and only while the reader is showing
the Bluetooth Transfer screen.

**On the reader**

    Device Connections → Bluetooth Transfer

The screen shows the reader's name (for example `E-inx X3 A31F`) and waits. Bluetooth is only
on while this screen is open; going Back shuts the radio down completely.

**On the phone**

1. Install **E-inx Send**. The APK is attached to the same GitHub release as the firmware —
   download `E-inx-Send.apk` and open it. Android will ask you to allow installing from your
   browser or files app the first time.
2. Open E-inx Send and tap **Choose Book**, or share a book to it from any app:
   Files → long-press the book → **Share** → **E-inx Send**.
3. The app lists readers that are waiting. Tap **Send** next to yours.
4. Progress shows on both screens. When it finishes, the book is in your library under
   **Books**.

Grant the Bluetooth permission when asked. The app never asks for location or for access to
your storage — it only reads the one file you picked.

**Supported formats:** EPUB, TXT, XTC and XTCH, up to 64 MB.

**If something goes wrong**

Both screens name the problem, and nothing is added to the library. Interrupted transfers clean
themselves up, so a failed send never leaves a half-written book behind — just try again.

- *No readers found* — the reader has to be on the Bluetooth Transfer screen, not just powered
  on. Check that Bluetooth is on for the phone too.
- *"That book is already on the reader"* — a book with that file name is already in `/Books`.
  Rename the file on the phone, or delete the old copy first.
- *"The file did not survive the transfer intact"* — the checksum did not match. This is the
  reader refusing a corrupted book; send it again.

The wire protocol is documented in [docs/BLE_FILE_TRANSFER.md](./docs/BLE_FILE_TRANSFER.md).

### 3.4.3 Reducing ghosting and flashing (X3)

Under **Settings → Experimental X3 Waveform**, three settings control how the reader repaints
while you read. They only apply to the X3, and the defaults behave exactly as before.

**Maintenance action** — what happens every *Refresh Frequency* pages:

| Action | Flashes? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full clean | Yes | The default. Fully resets ghosting. |
| Half scrub | Possibly | Drives every pixel to its target without first flashing to white. |
| Reinforce | No | Extra passes of the same waveform a page turn already uses. |
| None | No | Nothing is cleaned; ghosting keeps building. |

If flashing while reading is what bothers you most, try **Reinforce**, and lower *Refresh Frequency*
until ghosting stays acceptable. If ghosting is what bothers you most, keep **Full clean**.

**Page turn waveform** — which waveform an ordinary page turn uses: *Reinforce* (what E-inx ships),
*Fast (E-inx)*, or *Fast (YACP)*.

This only takes effect when **Reinforce B/W reader** is switched **off**. With that on, page turns
use the reinforcement waveform and this setting is ignored.

To reproduce the YACP firmware's no-flash reader — useful for comparing the two on the same book —
switch **Reinforce B/W reader** off, set **Page turn waveform** to *Fast (YACP)*, and set
**Maintenance action** to *Reinforce*.

**Opening a book always does a full clean**, whatever the maintenance action is set to. The panel
is showing whatever the last screen left behind, so a chapter starts from a clean slate.

**Maintenance passes** — how many reinforcement passes each maintenance tick runs. Only used when the
action is *Reinforce*. One pass matches YACP.

Note that **Periodic full clean** is a separate safety net: it forces a real clean after a number of
updates no matter which action is selected. Turn it off for no flashing at all, accepting that only
the maintenance action then bounds ghosting.

### 3.5 Settings

The Settings screen allows you to configure the device's behavior. There are a few settings you can adjust:
- **Sleep Screen**: Which sleep screen to display when the device sleeps:
  - "Dark" (default) - The default dark Crosspoint logo sleep screen
  - "Light" - The same default sleep screen, on a white background
  - "Custom" - Custom images from the SD card; see [Sleep Screen](#36-sleep-screen) below for more information
  - "Cover" - The book cover image (Note: this is experimental and may not work as expected)
  - "None" - A blank screen
- **Sleep Screen Cover Mode**: How to display the book cover when "Cover" sleep screen is selected:
  - "Fit" (default) - Scale the image down to fit centered on the screen, padding with white borders as necessary
  - "Crop" - Scale the image down and crop as necessary to try to to fill the screen (Note: this is experimental and may not work as expected)
- **Sleep Screen Cover Filter**: What filter will be applied to the book cover when "Cover" sleep screen is selected 
  - "None" (default) - The cover image will be converted to a grayscale image and displayed as it is
  - "Contrast" - The image will be displayed as a black & white image without grayscale conversion
  - "Inverted" - The image will be inverted as in white&black and will be displayed without grayscale conversion
- **Status Bar**: Configure the status bar displayed while reading:
  - "None" - No status bar
  - "No Progress" - Show status bar without reading progress
  - "Full" - Show status bar with reading progress
- **Hide Battery %**: Configure where to suppress the battery pecentage display in the status bar; the battery icon will still be shown:
  - "Never" - Always show battery percentage (default)
  - "In Reader" - Show battery percentage everywhere except in reading mode
  - "Always" - Always hide battery percentage
- **Extra Paragraph Spacing**: If enabled, vertical space will be added between paragraphs in the book. If disabled, paragraphs will not have vertical space between them, but will have first-line indentation.
- **Text Anti-Aliasing**: Whether to show smooth grey edges (anti-aliasing) on text in reading mode. Note this slows down page turns slightly.
- **Short Power Button Click**: Controls the effect of a short click of the power button:
  - "Ignore" - Require a long press to turn off the device
  - "Sleep" - A short press powers the device off
  - "Page Turn" - A short press in reading mode turns to the next page; a long press turns the device off
- **Reading Orientation**: Set the screen orientation for reading EPUB files:
  - "Portrait" (default) - Standard portrait orientation
  - "Landscape CW" - Landscape, rotated clockwise
  - "Inverted" - Portrait, upside down
  - "Landscape CCW" - Landscape, rotated counter-clockwise
- **Front Button Layout**: Configure the order of the bottom edge buttons:
  - Back, Confirm, Left, Right (default)
  - Left, Right, Back, Confirm
  - Left, Back, Confirm, Right
  - Back, Confirm, Right, Left
- **Side Button Layout (reader)**: Swap the order of the up and down volume buttons from Previous/Next to Next/Previous. This change is only in effect when reading.
- **Long-press Chapter Skip**: Set whether long-pressing page turn buttons skip to the next/previous chapter.
  - "Chapter Skip" (default) - Long-pressing skips to next/previous chapter
  - "Page Scroll" - Long-pressing scrolls a page up/down
- Swap the order of the up and down volume buttons from Previous/Next to Next/Previous. This change is only in effect when reading.
- **Reader Font Family**: Choose the font used for reading:
  - "Literata" (default)
  - "Atkinson Hyperlegible"
- **Reader Font Size**: Adjust the text size for reading; options are "Small", "Medium", "Large", or "X Large".
- **Reader Line Spacing**: Adjust the spacing between lines; options are "Tight", "Normal", or "Wide".
- **Reader Screen Margin**: Controls the screen margins in reader mode between 5 and 40 pixels in 5 pixel increments.
- **Reader Paragraph Alignment**: Set the alignment of paragraphs; options are "Justified" (default), "Left", "Center", or "Right".
- **Time to Sleep**: Set the duration of inactivity before the device automatically goes to sleep.
- **Refresh Frequency**: Set how often the screen does a full refresh while reading to reduce ghosting.
- **OPDS Browser**: Configure OPDS server settings for browsing and downloading books. Set the server URL (for Calibre Content Server, add `/opds` to the end), and optionally configure username and password for servers requiring authentication. You can also enter these values from the hotspot web dashboard's Settings page. Note: Only HTTP Basic authentication is supported. If using Calibre Content Server with authentication enabled, you must set it to use Basic authentication instead of the default Digest authentication.
- **Check for updates**: Check for firmware updates over WiFi.

### 3.6 Sleep Screen

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.bmp` file, and one will be randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

> [!TIP]
> For best results:
> - Use uncompressed BMP files with 24-bit color depth
> - Use a resolution of 480x800 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.
