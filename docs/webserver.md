# Web Server Guide

This guide explains how to connect your Inx Reader to WiFi and use the built-in web server to upload EPUB files from your computer or phone.

## Overview

Inx Reader includes a built-in web server that allows you to:

- Upload EPUB files wirelessly from any device on the same WiFi network
- Use **Network → Library Server** for a book-first Web UI with library thumbnails, stats, uploads, downloads, deletes, and indexing
- Browse and manage files on your device's SD card
- Create folders to organize your ebooks
- Delete files and folders

## Prerequisites

- Your Inx Reader device
- A WiFi network
- A computer, phone, or tablet connected to the **same WiFi network**

---

## Step 1: Accessing the WiFi Screen

1. From the main menu or file browser, navigate to the **Settings** screen
2. Select the **WiFi** option
3. The device will automatically start scanning for available networks

---

## Step 2: Connecting to WiFi

### Viewing Available Networks

Once the scan completes, you'll see a list of available WiFi networks with the following indicators:

- **Signal strength bars** (`||||`, `|||`, `||`, `|`) - Shows connection quality
- **`*` symbol** - Indicates the network is password-protected (encrypted)
- **`+` symbol** - Indicates you have previously saved credentials for this network

### Selecting a Network

1. Use the **Left/Right** (or **Volume Up/Down**) buttons to navigate through the network list
2. Press **Confirm** to select the highlighted network

### Entering Password (for encrypted networks)

If the network requires a password:

1. An on-screen keyboard will appear
2. Use the navigation buttons to select characters
3. Press **Confirm** to enter each character
4. When complete, select the **Done** option on the keyboard

**Note:** If you've previously connected to this network, the saved password will be used automatically.

### Connection Process

The device will display "Connecting..." while establishing the connection. This typically takes 5-10 seconds.

### Saving Credentials

If this is a new network, you'll be prompted to save the password:

- Select **Yes** to save credentials for automatic connection next time (NOTE: These are stored in plaintext on the device's SD card. Do not use this for sensitive networks.)
- Select **No** to connect without saving

---

## Step 3: Connection Success

Once connected, the screen will display:

- **Network name** (SSID)
- **IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.1.102`)
- **Web server URL** (e.g., `http://192.168.1.102/`)

<img src="./images/wifi/wifi_connected.jpeg" height="500">

**Important:** Make note of the IP address - you'll need this to access the web interface from your computer or phone.

---

## Step 4: Accessing the Web Interface

For library management, choose **Network → Library Server** on the reader. It first tries the most recently saved WiFi
network and opens `/library`; if that network cannot be reached, it automatically starts the library hotspot. While the
library server is showing, the front action button toggles between **Hotspot** and **WiFi** so you can switch connection
mode without returning to Device connections.

### From a Computer

1. Ensure your computer is connected to the **same WiFi network** as your Inx Reader
2. Open any web browser (Chrome is recommended)
3. Type the IP address shown on your device into the browser's address bar
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Press Enter

### From a Phone or Tablet

1. Ensure your phone/tablet is connected to the **same WiFi network** as your Inx Reader
2. Open your mobile browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
3. Type the IP address into the address bar
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Tap Go

## Step 5: Using the Web Interface

### Home Page

The home page displays:

- Device status and version information
- WiFi connection status
- Current IP address
- Available memory

Navigation links:

- **Home** - Returns to the status page
- **File Manager** - Access file management features

### File Manager

Click **File Manager** to access file management features.

#### Browsing Files

- The file manager displays all files and folders on your SD card
- **Folders** are highlighted in yellow with a 📁 icon
- **EPUB files** are highlighted in green with a 📗 icon
- Click on a folder name to navigate into it
- Use the breadcrumb navigation at the top to go back to parent folders

#### Uploading EPUB Files

1. Click the **+ Add** button in the top-right corner
2. Select **Upload eBook** from the dropdown menu
3. Click **Choose File** and select an `.epub` file from your device
4. Click **Upload**
5. A progress bar will show the upload status
6. The page will automatically refresh when the upload is complete

**Note:** Only `.epub` files are accepted. Other file types will be rejected.

#### Creating Folders

1. Click the **+ Add** button in the top-right corner
2. Select **New Folder** from the dropdown menu
3. Enter a folder name (must not contain characters \" * : < > ? / \\ | and must not be . or ..)
4. Click **Create Folder**

This is useful for organizing your ebooks by genre, author, or series.

### Settings

Open **Settings** from the navigation bar to edit device settings from your browser. The page includes WiFi credentials, reader/display options, KOReader Sync, and OPDS Browser settings.

For OPDS, set the server URL, username, and password from the web page instead of typing them on the device keyboard. If a password is already saved, the password field stays blank; leaving it blank keeps the saved password, entering a new value replaces it, and **Clear** removes it.

#### Deleting Files and Folders

1. Click the **🗑️** (trash) icon next to any file or folder
2. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
3. Click **Delete** to permanently remove the item

**Warning:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone!

**Note:** Folders must be empty before they can be deleted.

## Command Line File Management

For power users, you can manage files directly from your terminal using `curl` while the device is in File Upload mode a detailed documentation can be found [here](./webserver-endpoints.md). 

## Security Notes

- The web server runs on port 80 (standard HTTP)
- **No authentication is required** - anyone on the same network can access the interface
- The web server is only accessible while the WiFi screen shows "Connected"
- The web server automatically stops when you exit the WiFi screen
- For security, only use on trusted private networks

---

## Technical Details

- **Supported WiFi:** 2.4GHz networks (802.11 b/g/n)
- **Web Server Port:** 80 (HTTP)
- **Maximum Upload Size:** Limited by available SD card space
- **Supported File Format:** `.epub` only
- **Browser Compatibility:** All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Local Simulator

The CrossPoint simulator can run the full Inx SDL/device UI locally:

```sh
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SD=./fs_ pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator
```

When the simulated device starts a hotspot or local network server, open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/settings`.

For faster dashboard-only checks:

```sh
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SD=./fs_ pio run -e simulator_web -t run_simulator
```

For more details, see the [CrossPoint simulator project](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-simulator).

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Organize with folders** - Create folders before uploading to keep your library organized
2. **Check signal strength** - Stronger signals (`|||` or `||||`) provide faster, more reliable uploads
3. **Upload multiple files** - You can upload files one at a time; the page refreshes after each upload
4. **Use descriptive names** - Name your folders clearly (e.g., "SciFi", "Mystery", "Non-Fiction")
5. **Keep credentials saved** - Save your WiFi password for quick reconnection in the future
6. **Exit when done** - Press **Back** to exit the WiFi screen and save battery

---

## Exiting WiFi Mode

When you're finished uploading files:

1. Press the **Back** button on your Inx Reader
2. The web server will automatically stop
3. WiFi will disconnect to conserve battery
4. You'll return to the previous screen

Your uploaded files will be immediately available in the file browser!
